## Background

I wrote this program as a coding exercise. It's meant for two people to play together, sharing the same computer.

## Running the code locally

If you've [installed Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can clone this repo, `cd` into its directory at the command line, then run the game using `cargo run`.
